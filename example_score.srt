; To run this example add the -Lstdin flag to ./hypatia (which only works on UNIX)
; Then (in your *unix* terminal) type:
; ./hypatia < example_score.srt

; The following score assumes that 707kick.wav, 707snare.wav,
; and 707closedhat.wav are all in the current working directory
; (wherever main.csd is running). Moreover, that at least 3 Parts and
; 2 FXSends are allocated booting Hypatia. The defaults when booting are sufficient.

; This is an example (albeit a fraction of the sonic possibilities proffered)
; of what controlling hypatia would look like. It's CSound score, and I for one
; would prefer *not* to write this CSound score by hand.
; I recommend a wrapper language of some ilk to generate the score necessary.

; Nota bene, regarding the score below.
; Hypatia (CSound really) needs initialization time to create the Part & FXsend
; ftables before using any of the SetXXX instruments (which themselves
; modify Part & FXsend ftables). Hence, most of the the instrument calls
; below aren't at startTime 0, but 1. If this initialization time is not
; granted, the SetXXX instruments behave in wacky ways
; (you can read that as don't work at all).
